# Near Me
  Near Me is my Capstone project for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. This app is suitable to travelers 
who want to explore new places around their current location. The user can search for places via some categories or
via text. The user can also save his favorite places so as to find them faster and he can keep in them on his home screen via app's widget.
## Features
Near Me uses the following:
* Firebase Realtime Database
* Maps SDK for Android
* Places API
* Firebase Authentication
* AdMob
* Material Design
## Prerequisities for own use
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You need to create a resource file under values directory.
```
app/main/res/values/secrets.xml
```
In this file, you need to add your API key as below:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="API_KEY">"YOUR_API_KEY"</string>
</resources>
```
